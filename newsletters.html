<h3><a name="#WalkingNZ" id="WalkingNZ"></a>1. 'Walking NZ'</h3>
      <h3>Ten-day Walking Festival in Rotorua</h3>
      <p>Rotorua is known for its scenic lakes,  forests and geothermal wonderland. The Rotorua Walking Festival being held from  9 to 18 March 2012 will include walks in native and commercial forests,  through areas with geysers, mud pools and thermal springs, along the edge of  Lake Rotorua, and guided walks at Lakes Okataina and Tarawera. The walking  events range from a challenging marathon walk in Whakarewarewa  forest, to family  walks that can include the tots in pushchairs. All the walks are recreational  and non-competitive and are organised by the Rotorua Walking Festival Organizing Committee, the  Department of Conservation, and Events and Venues Rotorua of the Rotorua  District Council.</p>
<p>On  Saturday 12 March volunteer guides from the Mount Ngongotaha Bush Restoration  Trust will accompany walkers on this volcanic dome of 757 meters which sits  right beside the city of Rotorua. There is an easy loop nature walk through unlogged  native forest on the lower slopes of the mountain. More ambitious walkers can  continue to the summit along the historic Jubilee Track cut by the people of  Rotorua in 1890.</p>
<p>On the  following day the SPCA is organising a Paws Walk for dogs on leashes and their  owners and friends in the Redwoods, a magnificent stand of Californian sequoia  trees on the edge of the city.</p>
<p>Over  this first weekend of the Festival there are two walks which have been  organised for residents of Rotorua. The Department of Conservation will provide  a sneak preview of the first 14 km of the Tarawera Trail, from the Buried  Village to Hot Water Beach, to the locals. This part of the trail will be  opened to the public some time in 2011. Eventually the trail will provide a  multi-day walk right around Lake Tarawera.</p>
<p>The  second event for the locals, on Sunday, 13 March, will be a boat trip to Mokoia  Island in the heart of Lake Rotorua, offered at a discounted price. The day  will include a guided tour of the island, an introduction to the native forest  and to the endangered birds that have found a sanctuary there, and a hot soak  in Hinemoa&rsquo;s Pool. Wai Ora Experiences run similar trips daily for visitors.</p>
<p>During  the following week there will be organised walks in the Redwood Forest, or locals  and visitors can join various existing Rotorua walking and tramping groups. An  example is the Rotorua Cross Country Walking Group that organises solid  full-day walks requiring a moderate level of fitness on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>The highlights  of the Rotorua Walking Festival are the International Walks, being offered for  the 18th year by the Rotary Club of Rotorua West. These leisure  walks provide great scenery, fun, fellowship and a real sense of achievement  when those who complete two walks over the weekend receive a medal. On  Saturday, 19 March, there is a choice of 10 km, half marathon, or marathon walks  through Whakarewarewa Forest. This magnificent forest has dozens of tree  species and was established in 1901 as an experiment to test the suitability of  different native and exotic forest species for commercial planting. The  management of this forest now includes strategies to welcome recreational  users.</p>
<p>On  Sunday, 20 March the 10, 20 or 30 km walks go along boardwalks through clouds  of steam drift, over boiling mud and steaming fumaroles, past the Sulphur Bay bird  sanctuary on Lake Rotorua, along the lakefront, and through city parks and  garden suburbs. Marshalls along the routes provide encouragement and drinks.  Some of the areas on these walks are very dangerous with signs to advise  walkers to stay on the path at all times.</p>
<p>For  those who prefer walking in native forests and along lakes, there are two  guided forest walks to chose from on the Sunday. A 22 km walk goes from Lake  Okataina to Lake Tarawera and then along the Tarawera River to the stunning  Tarawera Falls. There are charming picnic spots along the river to stop for  lunch. Those interested in native ferns will be delighted by the many species  found here. Transport is provided to drop the walkers off, and to pick them up  near Kawerau. Those who do not feel up to this walk which requires a moderate  to high level of fitness can opt for a boat ride from Tarawera Landing to the  Tarawera Outlet from where they can walk for as far as they chose along the  river and then return back to the boat.</p>
<p>All are  welcome on the International Walks in which hundreds of overseas visitors also  participate. These walks of international quality are part of the IML Walking  Association&rsquo;s programme and walkers who complete walks of at least 20 km on each  of the two days receive IML medals.</p>
<p>After a  full day of walking, Rotorua&rsquo;s internationally famous hot bathing pools and  spas will beckon. The final weekend programme includes a dinner cruise on the Lakeland  Queen and a prizegiving on Sunday afternoon. All the International Walks start  from the clubrooms of the Netherlands Society in Neil Hunt Park, where  refreshments will be available and entertainment provided.</p>
<p>Just in  case the Walking Festival is not providing a walk that suits your level of  fitness or interest on a particular day, there are lots of other walks to do in  and around Rotorua. There are free walks at Hamurana Springs, along Lake  Rotorua at Hannah&rsquo;s Bay, and on the 26 km Rotorua Walkway which is broken up  into eight shorter sections. </p>
<p>Registration  is required for the International Walks and for some of the other walks of the Rotorua  Walking Festival. Information on how to register and on all the walks is  provided on <a href="http://www.rotoruawalkingfestival.org.nz">www.rotoruawalkingfestival.org.nz</a></p>
<p>There  are discounted registration fees for families and teams, and for those who  register for both days of the International Walks.</p>

<h3>2. a reason to enter the &quot;19th Rotorua Walking Festival&quot;</h3>
<p>Have you been looking for a reason to visit  steaming, boiling, scenic Rotorua? The Rotary Club of Rotorua West is providing  the perfect reason for you to visit in March 2012. The Club is organising, for  the 18th time, the Rotorua Walking Festival between 11 and 20 March.  Over ten days there will be 19 different walks, from easy strolls through the  city to a Marathon Walk in Whakarewarewa   Forest.</p>
<p>The walks are non-competitive and  recreational with levels of difficulty to suit all ages and degrees of fitness.  The highlight of the Festival is over the final Saturday and Sunday when walks  that are recognised by the international IML Walking Association take place. On  the Saturday there are walks of 10 km, a half-marathon, and a marathon along  spectacular tracks in Whakarewarewa Forest that let you explore some of New Zealand&rsquo;s  finest forest scenery with majestic trees and ferns. On the Sunday, the walkers  head into Rotorua city on routes of 10, 20 or 30 km, through an active  geothermal reserve with boardwalks to get over boiling mud, past a bird  sanctuary, and on to the lake and city parks. If you prefer forest walks, two  more are offered on the Sunday: a 22 km walk from Lake Okataina to the bottom  of the spectacular Tarawera Falls (good level of fitness required), or the much  easier option: by boat across Lake Tarawera to its outlet, and then a stroll  along the river as far as you want to go, returning to the boat for the cruise  back to Tarawera Landing. </p>
<p>Earlier in the week there will be a  nocturnal forest walk to see glow worms and opportunities to join the Rotorua  Cross Country Walking Group. Especially for New South Wales visitors, a full week of  sightseeing around Rotorua has been organised. This trip runs from Tuesday, 15  March to Tuesday, 22 March to make use of the direct Air NZ flights between  Sydney and Rotorua. With experienced volunteer Rotary guides and support from  tourism operators the cost of the trip, ex Rotorua Airport and inclusive of  accommodation, most meals and participation in the International Walks over the  weekend, has been kept down to AUS$1049. New Zealand members of Grey Power  are of course most welcome to join this sightseeing week, too. </p>
<p>Further information on the walks, registration  fees and the one-week tour to Rotorua as well as a registration form are on <a href="http://www.rotoruawalkingfestival.org.nz">www.rotoruawalkingfestival.org.nz</a>.</p>
