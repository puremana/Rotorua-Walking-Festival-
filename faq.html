		<p><span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> Who organises the Walking Festival?<br>
<span class="answer"><b><span class="answer">A:</span> </b></span> The festival is an annual project organised for the community by the NZ Walking Association which was established in 2012 by Deryck Shaw (chair). Enlisting help from private individuals and organisations, the event has been able to continue with enthusiasm and commitment ensuring the Rotorua Walking Festival continues to be a quality event that encourages New Zealanders and international visitors to develop friendships and share their love of walking. Prior to 2012 the event was organised by the Rotary Club of Rotorua West.</p>

        times</strong> - Do I have to start at the scheduled times? <br>
        <strong><span class="answer">A:</span> </strong>Yes - we use mass starts for each 
        route because the route markings and station marshalls are temporary and 
        arranged separately for each start time and will not be in place to guide 
        you if you were to start earlier or later than the scheduled time for 
        the route. </p>
