	  </div>
	  <p>Just a brief note to advise that the next Rotorua Walking Festival (New Zealand) will be held on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 March in 2016.  </p>
	  <p>We have had to change our walk dates because of an international mountain bike festival (Crankworx – also held in France and Canada) which brings thousands of people into Rotorua.  This will be in Rotorua from 9-13 March 2016 which puts it in direct competition to the walking festival (same weekend) for accommodation and use of the forest.</p>
	  <p>We apologise for any inconvenience around the dates as we realise that some people may have already made arrangements, but in shifting the date it makes it much easier for accommodation, reduces any issues between walkers and bikers in the forest and also brings the event a little closer to the Canberra weekend of walks.</p>
	  <p>Also we have a 20 year pictorial history of the Rotorua Walking Festival on YouTube.  The link is here and it has been added to the IML Walking Association Website as well - <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LBkt1hSuTc&feature=em">click on the link.</a></p>
	  <p>The link for the  <a href=" http://www.imlwalking.org/#/members/Rotorua">pictorial history of the Rotorua Walking Festival</a> is on our page of IML’s website - </p>
	  <p>Please contact me if there is any further information you require.</p>
	  <p>Kind regards

	  <p> The Rotorua Walking Festival is an exciting and vibrant annual event. There are walks that will suit everyone, from old to young, fast to slow. For all walks you will only need a comfortable pair of shoes so it is the easiest form of exercise to get involved in. We want to encourage as many people as possible to enter along with friends, families, and  workmates to find out how beneficial it is to be outdoors and active.</p>
	  <p> While there are walks on two days available, you can walk either day or both days. From 10km to 42km walks, from the forest to the geothermal parks – there is a distance which suits every fitness level. The Walking Festival is non-competitive and  provides walkers with great scenery, fellowship, and a real sense of achievement upon completion.</p>
	  <p> The walk attracts an enthusiastic group of walkers from New Zealand, Australia, Europe, Japan and the wider Asia area. On the first day, the three distances are based in the Whakarewarewa Forest – which contains a contrast of tree types from majestic  redwoods, to a number of exotic  forestry plantings. The redwoods are great, as they appeal to every level and ability – and also have many great vantage points were walkers can look over Rotorua and see the stunning lakes and geothermal areas. </p>
	  <p> Day one has three walks – a 10km walk, 21km walk (half marathon), and for the keen walkers  out there the 42km (Full marathon) walk – all which show of Rotorua’s amazing trails amongst dense bush and overlooking the lakes.</p>  
	  <p> Day two has a completely different feel to it – with walkers following routes through urban environments, past cafés, the beautiful lakefront and past Rotorua’s world famous geothermal hot spots. The distances on day two include  10km, 20km, and 30km walks. </p>
	  <p> The Rotorua Walking Festival is a great weekend out for all – with the added benefits of being active in a beautiful non-competitive environment.</p>
